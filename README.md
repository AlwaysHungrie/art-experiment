# Art Experiment

Humans have always used tools to express themselves—starting from primitive cave paintings, to the invention of the printing press, to modern image editing software. Each tool has extended our creative reach. But for some reason, when it comes to AI-assisted tools, this progress suddenly feels like a line we're hesitant to cross.

On March 25, 2025, OpenAI released its latest model. The internet was quickly flooded with "Ghibli-style" images—dreamlike scenes that resonated deeply with people. Only after the initial wave of excitement did the ethical debates begin.

What made those AI-generated images so compelling was the perceived human touch they carried. The Ghibli aesthetic is rich in emotion, detail, and narrative—qualities we associate with human creativity. Ironically, the same reason people loved these images is also why others objected: they couldn’t tell if a human was behind the art anymore. The discomfort came not from what the image depicted, but from the absence of a visible human creator.

This experiment is a response to that tension. It aims to amplify the humanness—or lack thereof—in AI art.

When you use this tool, an AI-generated image is created completely without your control. You don’t choose the style, the subject, or the colors. There is no prompt, no guidance, no human hand in the process at all. It is pure AI output. In doing so, this experiment pushes AI art to its furthest, most unsettling edge.

This is what true AI-generated art looks like—not what you carefully crafted using ChatGPT or image tools, but something entirely autonomous. It’s not just an artistic statement—it’s a moral and ethical provocation.

Stop airdrop farming,

I’m giving 800 USDC to anyone who can spot the AI-generated image between these two images

Here's the thing, both of them were generated using ai. 
But I can [ZK] prove one of them had no human involved in the process at all.
